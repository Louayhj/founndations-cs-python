a = int(input("enter the first number"))

# i know u did not mention the min and max variables in the class but i find it a lot easier than implementing nested if conditions
maximum = max(a,b,c)
minimum = min(a,b,c)
print(" The maximum value is " , maximum)
print(" The minimum value is " , minimum)
